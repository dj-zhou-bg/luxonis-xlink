### Note

This repo is a copy from `depthai-core`, in which the Hunter config is:
```text
hunter_config(
    XLink
    VERSION "luxonis-2021.4.2-develop"
    URL "https://github.com/luxonis/XLink/archive/1ef2f960eec66540891434c9a3341c11e66e4360.tar.gz"
    SHA1 "23641bb9ae698d0e016abcce349094a38577838b"
)
```

I will remove the Hunter from this repo.

# XLink

This is a "fork" of openvino repositories third party dependency - XLink.

# Changes
Some tweaks to CMake files to enable installation of this target and being able to be used with Hunter package manager
